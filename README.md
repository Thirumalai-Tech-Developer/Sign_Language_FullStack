<h1>**Sign Language FullStack 🤟🧠**</h1>

A Full Stack Deep Learning Application that performs **Sign Language Classification** and converts sign gestures into **Text and Voice**.

The system uses a trained deep learning model with **10,000+ training samples** and a **Django-based backend** to serve predictions through a web interface.

---

<h1>**🚀 Project Overview**</h1>

This project helps improve communication for people using **sign language** by automatically recognizing hand gestures and converting them into readable text or speech.

The system processes sign inputs, predicts the meaning using a trained model, and outputs the result through a web interface.

Main goals of this project:

• 🤟 Recognize sign language gestures
• 🧠 Classify gestures using a deep learning model
• 📝 Convert signs into text
• 🔊 Generate voice from predicted text
• 🌐 Provide a simple web interface

<h1>**🧠 Model Information**</h1>

Model File
model/GT.pth

Dataset Size
10,000+ training samples

The model is trained to recognize **sign language gestures** and classify them into meaningful outputs.
